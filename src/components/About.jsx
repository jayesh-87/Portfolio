      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Jayesh — a Full-Stack Developer and Data-Science enthusiast.</p>
      <p>
        I work across backend, frontend, and data-driven applications.
        I’m passionate about building scalable web apps, working with machine learning / data pipelines,
        and bridging the gap between data and user-facing interfaces.

      <p>When I’m not coding I enjoy reading and photography.</p>
